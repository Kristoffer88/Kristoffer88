Building AI-powered developer tools. Background in Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform.

## Business Applications

Working with the Dynamics 365 suite — model-driven apps, Dataverse, server-side plugins (C#/.NET), and client-side customizations with TypeScript. Building and extending business applications across sales, service, and finance with a focus on clean integration patterns and maintainable code.

## Work Management

Background in project and portfolio management solutions on top of Dynamics 365 and Dataverse. Familiar with Project Operations, Project for the Web, and ISV solutions for resource planning, time tracking, and strategy execution — the kind of tooling that connects PMOs with finance and delivery teams.

## Power Platform

Building custom PCF controls, Power Apps solutions, and Power Automate flows. Hands-on with ALM pipelines, managed environments, solution packaging, and the full dev lifecycle from `pac pcf init` to production deployment. Comfortable bridging the gap between low-code makers and pro-code development.
